# funloop

This is a repository that collects several of my programming projects to pass some plesant time with my computer. 
This are done as warm-up exercise.

## Interpreter for funloop 

The ipython notebook `funloop.ipynb` implements a customized interpreter for a language I have created. 
This language has a limited number of arithmetic operations, capability of running nested loops, and nested 
if-else type statmenets. And it also implements recursive function calling, with local variable scope. 

```text
# recursive factorial 

input = 4


def fact n
    if n 1 <=
        output = 1
    else 
        output = n 1 - fact n *
    fi
fed 

output = input fact
```

Here, the fucntion `fact` takes positive integer `n` as an input and outputs the factorial of it. 

Several example code written in this customized script is given in the `code` folder. 

## Advent of Code

The `AOC` folder contains my solutions to Advent of code problems.  

## Sandbox 

Experimental code that tests various python libraries functionalities. 

A sandbox for playful ideas.
